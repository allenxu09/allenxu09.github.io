Hi there, I am Allen Xu, currently a senior student (graduate of **2027**) at [Shenzhen College of International Education](https://scie.com.cn/).

I am a passionate learner and researcher in the field of computer science. I co-founded the **Mathematics And Computer Science Club** (M&CS for short) with my friend Tiger Shu, one of the biggest academic ECAs at SCIE. 
We have organized numerous events, including lectures and competitions, to promote interest in mathematics and computer science among peers. 
In particular, we have hosted the **1024 Coding Challenge**, which has become an annual, prestigious event for students interested in programming and algorithmic problems.

Beyond academics, I also have deep interests in both **music** and **philosophy**. I claim myself to be an "amateur" composer, where I enjoy creating music in my free time. 
I have my musician account **Allen Xu** on [Tencent Music](https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq/singer/001KW0bV14rcka), where I share my original compositions. Hope you enjoy them!
